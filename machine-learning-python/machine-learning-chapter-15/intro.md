In this scenario, we will talk about Backpropagation. This tutorial is broken down into 6 parts:
1. Initialize Network.
2. Forward-Propagate.
3. Backpropagate Error.
4. Train Network.
5. Predict.
6. Wheat Seeds Case Study.

These steps will provide the foundation that you need to implement the backpropagation
algorithm from scratch and apply it to your own predictive modeling problems
