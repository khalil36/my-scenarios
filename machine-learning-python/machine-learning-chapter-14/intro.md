In this scenario, we will talk about Vector Quantization. This tutorial is broken down into 4 parts:
1. Euclidean Distance.
2. Best Matching Unit.
3. Training Codebook Vectors.
4. Ionosphere Case Study.

These steps will lay the foundation for implementing and applying the LVQ algorithm to
your own predictive modeling problems.
