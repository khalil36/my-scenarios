In this scenario, we will learn about Multivariate Linear Regression. This tutorial is broken down into 3 parts:
1. Making Predictions.
2. Estimating Coefficients.
3. Wine Quality Case Study.

This will provide the foundation you need to implement and apply linear regression with
stochastic gradient descent on your own predictive modeling problems.
