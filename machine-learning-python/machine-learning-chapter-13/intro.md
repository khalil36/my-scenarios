In this scenario, we will talk about k-Nearest Neighbors.

This tutorial is broken down into 5 parts:
1. Euclidean Distance.
2. Get Neighbors.
3. Make Predictions.
4. Abalone Case Study as Classification.
5. Abalone Case Study as Regression.

These steps will teach you the fundamentals of implementing and applying the k-Nearest
Neighbors algorithm for classification and regression predictive modeling problems.
