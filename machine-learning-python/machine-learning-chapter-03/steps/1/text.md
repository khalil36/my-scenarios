In this scenario, we will cover following topics.

1. Train and Test Split.
2. k-fold Cross-Validation Split.

These steps will provide the foundations you need to handle resampling your dataset to
estimate algorithm performance on new data.

There is also an integrated editor and terminal to run our python code.
