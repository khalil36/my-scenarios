In this scenario, we will learn about Perceptron. This tutorial is broken down into 3 parts:
1. Making Predictions.
2. Training Network Weights.
3. Sonar Case Study.

These steps will give you the foundation to implement and apply the Perceptron algorithm
to your own classification predictive modeling problems.
