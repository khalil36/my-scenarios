In this scenario, we will learn Naive Bayes. This tutorial is broken down into 6 parts:
1. Separate By Class.
2. Summarize Dataset.
3. Summarize Data By Class.
4. Gaussian Probability Density Function.
5. Class Probabilities.
6. Iris Flower Species Case Study.

These steps will provide the foundation that you need to implement Naive Bayes from scratch
and apply it to your own predictive modeling problems.
