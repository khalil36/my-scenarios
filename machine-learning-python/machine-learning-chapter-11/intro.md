In this scenario, we will learn Classification and Regression Trees. This tutorial is broken down into 5 parts:
1. Gini Index.
2. Create Split.
3. Build a Tree.
4. Make a Prediction.
5. Banknote Case Study.

These steps will give you the foundation that you need to implement the CART algorithm
from scratch and apply it to your own predictive modeling problems.
